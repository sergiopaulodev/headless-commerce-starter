# Commerce Starter — Evolution Repository

This repository is the active evolution of a frozen technical MVP.

It is used to:
- Explore UI and UX improvements
- Add contract and provider tests
- Evolve domain contracts (v2+)
- Prepare a reusable commerce starter template

The original MVP remains untouched and serves as a reference baseline.

Domain contracts are documented in /lib/commerce/contracts.
